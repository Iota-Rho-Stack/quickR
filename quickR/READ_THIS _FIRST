Hello World!

Thank you for downloading the quickR script pack! Designed to let you analyze more and code less in R.
It is highly advisable to use this pack within an Rproject using Rstudio cloud (https://rstudio.cloud).
Set up a new project and git clone this repository therein.
There are installation and command instructions in each folder.

This pack is provided as is, with NO WARRANTY.
I am not liable for loss of data or loss of functionality to your device in conjunction with this script pack.

If you see a potential improvement, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn.
This is my first full "app" written in R so please pardon the appearance/functionality while further improvements are made.

Though quickR is intended to make competing in Kaggle competitions more streemlined while using R, it can be used in conjunction with any data analysis.

Please don't forget to share, watch, and star this project. 

Best,

-JR
